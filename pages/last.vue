        Iffah,<br /><br />I would like to say Thank You for accepting my
        invitation. I remembered you saying that it would be different if I am
        around. It would be great to talk and meet with you physically.
        Unfortunately, circumstances happen preventing me doing so. Because of
        that, I came up with this outing.<br /><br />
        This outing is nothing other than about you. I just wanted to let you
        know that you are beautiful, amazing, talented, and strong in many ways.
        Your story is as important as others. And, your kindness spread
        happiness to others around you. At least that was what we experienced.
        <br /><br />
        I hope you enjoy the outing today. From lunch, to the nail parlor, and
        so on. This is something I'd do with a close friend or someone I cared.
        I am not expecting anything from today, just trying my best to make you
        enjoy your moment in KL and hopefully make your day better.<br /><br />-
        Riza
